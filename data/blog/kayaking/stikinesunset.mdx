# Stikine Sunset

![Stikine Sunset](/static/images/kayaking/stikineSunset.jpg)

Even the sunsets are more epic on the Stikine. It's amazing to think that they almost built a dam here at Site Zed, and the world would have lost the raw wonder of this place forever. The bench we're camping on is wholly unnatural: it's the only flat spot within probably 5 miles. It was built to support the dam, and there's still old equipment in the area. There even used to be huts there, apparently.
