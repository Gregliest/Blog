I took a road trip through Utah in the winter of 2013.  In Capitol Reef National Park, it snowed a couple of inches during the night, and I was able to snap this shot of the truly massive guardian of the loop road.  I think I may have been the only visitor in the park that night and morning, those are my tracks in the picture.
