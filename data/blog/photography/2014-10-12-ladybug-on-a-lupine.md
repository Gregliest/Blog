This image is one of my very first macro photos, from way back in June 2010. I had just bought a spanking new 85mm macro lens, and was trying it out in Yosemite National Park, near Hetch Hetchy reservoir. I got super lucky, the bug, the flower, and the focus all came together for this image, and I've been hooked on macro photography ever since.
