# South Salmon Camping

![South Salmon Camping](/static/images/photography/sSalmon.jpg)

Camping along the epic South Fork of the Salmon River, ID.

There's a proposed mine in the headwaters that could destroy this pristine and wild place. The South Fork really should be Wild and Scenic, it's one of the best rivers in the lower 48. Stop the mine!
