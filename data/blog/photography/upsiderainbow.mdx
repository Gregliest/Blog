# Upside Down Rainbow

![Upside Down Rainbow](/static/images/photography/upsideRainbow.jpg)

Boston, MA.

This one's pretty cool. I was looking up at the sky on winter day, and noticed a weird looking rainbow. It was brighter than a normal rainbow, upside down relative to the sun, and had a much shorter arc. Of course, I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole trying to figure out what was going on. Turns out, this rainbow is caused by high altitude ice crystals, which refract at a different angle than water droplets, which form normal rainbows. The ice is clearer than water too, hence the brightness.

Also, I learned about elves and sprites, and other cool stuff. You can too if you follow me down the WikiHole.
