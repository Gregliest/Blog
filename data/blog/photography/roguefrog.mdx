# Rogue Frog

![Rogue Frog](/static/images/photography/rogueFrog.jpg)

This little guy was super friendly on our first Rogue trip. We had no idea what we were doing, or how to pack for a multiday kayak trip. I think this is the time we didn't bring sleeing pads. Oh to be in my early 20s again, I would not survive that now.
