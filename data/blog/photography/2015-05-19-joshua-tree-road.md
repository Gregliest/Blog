Hidden Valley Campground, Joshua Tree National Park, USA.  I had wanted to climb, but the weather decided not to cooperate: Joshua Tree got about 20% of its annual rainfall that day.  Brutal.  So, I decided to scramble up one of the rock piles in the middle of the camp, and managed to catch this long exposure of a car looking for a campsite.  I did end up getting on some classics after everything dried out.
