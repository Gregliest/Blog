# Hidden Valley Campground, Joshua Tree National Park, USA

I had wanted to climb, but the weather decided not to cooperate: Joshua Tree got about 20% of its annual rainfall that day. Brutal. So, I decided to scramble up one of the rock piles in the middle of the camp, and managed to catch this long exposure of a car looking for a campsite. I did end up getting on some classics after everything dried out.
