# Capitol Reef Giant, Capitol Reef National Park, USA

![Capitol Reef](/static/images/photography/capitol-reef-tree.jpg)

I took a road trip through Utah in the winter of 2013. In Capitol Reef National Park, it snowed a couple of inches during the night, and I was able to snap this shot of the truly massive guardian of the loop road. I think I may have been the only visitor in the park that night and morning, those are my tracks in the picture.
